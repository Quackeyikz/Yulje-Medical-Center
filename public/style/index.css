body {
    background-color: rebeccapurple;
}

/* 
    You know why there's no page in the web that has rebeccapurple color as background?
    BECAUSE THE CSS DON'T FREAKING WORK!!!
    
    I've tried anything from modularity to static path declaration,
    AND NONE OF EM ARE WORKING!!!!

    And guess what's more irritating?
    It seems like this problem is occuring ONLY TO ME!
    This feels so targeted ngl.
